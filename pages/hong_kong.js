              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong: a world-class city that brings together East and West like no other. With its towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and rich cultural heritage, Hong Kong provides a vibrant urban experience while still offering natural beauty with its scenic hiking trails and meandering coastlines.

              <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest draws of Hong Kong is its international job market and strong economy. As a global financial hub, the city offers numerous opportunities in sectors like finance, tech, and hospitality. English is widely spoken in the workplace, making it easier for Canadians to integrate, and Hong Kong has a strong expat community, so itâ€™s easy to connect with other travelers and professionals.
